## Project Structure

The project consists of a Jupyter notebook that contains SQL queries and the corresponding analysis. The notebook is organized as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the project and objectives.
2. **Data Loading**: Loading the dataset into a SQL database.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Performing initial data exploration to understand the dataset.
4. **SQL Queries**: Detailed SQL queries to analyze various aspects of the football data.
5. **Results Visualization**: Visualization of the results obtained from SQL queries.

## Datasets

The dataset used in this project includes football player statistics from 2015 to 2024. It encompasses:

- Player names
- Matches played
- Goals scored
- Assists made
- Teams played for
- Various other performance metrics

## SQL Queries and Analysis

The analysis is conducted using a series of SQL queries, each addressing a specific question or aspect of the football data. Some key queries include:

1. **Average Matches per Season**: Calculating the average number of matches played per season by each player.
2. **Top Goal Scorers**: Identifying the players with the highest total goals scored in their careers.
3. **Assist Leaders**: Finding the teams with the highest average assists per match.
4. **Performance Consistency**: Evaluating the consistency of player performance across seasons.
5. **Team Contributions**: Analyzing the contributions of players to their respective teams.

## Results

The results of the analysis provide valuable insights into football player performance, such as:

- Average match participation rates
- Leading goal scorers and assist providers
- Team performance dynamics
- Player consistency over multiple seasons
